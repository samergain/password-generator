# Password Generator
This application generates a random password based on criteria selected by the user. 

# How Does It Work?
One page application with popup windows (enable popup's in your browser to test the application).
"Generate Password" button triggers a series of popups that require the user to enter password desired length and criteria of characters. 

Length should be between 8 and 128.

And, at least one criteria should be selected.

Finally, a password is generated on screen based on user selections.
